# Homing-Robot-Reinforcement-Learning-Agent

My first Reinforcement Learning work.
A simple homing Robot Reinforcement Learning Agent done as part of the Adaptive Intelligence module at The University of Sheffield.

The repository includes the documented source code which creates an experimentation function and plots the errors.
